   - Control flow and basic operations

2. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Classes and objects
   - Inheritance and polymorphism
   - Interfaces and abstract classes
   - Encapsulation and information hiding

3. **Java Standard Library**
   - Collections framework
   - I/O and NIO operations
   - Exception handling
   - Date and time API

4. **Advanced Java Concepts**
   - Generics and type safety
   - Streams and functional programming
   - Concurrency and multithreading
   - Reflection and annotations

5. **Practical Applications**
   - Building applications with JavaFX
   - Database connectivity with JDBC
   - RESTful services with Spring Boot
   - Testing strategies with JUnit and Mockito

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
